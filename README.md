WireGuard is a VPN protocol â€” the way that a client (like your computer or phone) communicates with a VPN server. Wireguard was merged into the Linux 5.6 kernel in March 2020.
Wireguard basically can be used to create tunnel between two namespace. WireGuard uses ChaCha20 for symmetric encryption with Poly1305 for message authentication.
Our task in this project is to connect two interfaces which are present in different network through wireguard VPN.
